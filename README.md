# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Product Recommendation System

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of an **E-Commerce Product Recommendation System** that suggests products to users based on their historical interactions. 

The system is built using Python, data science libraries, and recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering.

## üìå Project Overview

In today's digital marketplace, recommending relevant products to customers significantly boosts engagement, sales, and user satisfaction. 

This project demonstrates how to build a product recommendation engine using machine learning techniques such as:

- Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization using SVD)

- Evaluation using Precision, Recall, and NDCG

- Data preparation for recommendation engines

- Integration-ready Python code and notebook

The data sets are from

1. Amazon product ratings by multipe users, Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/skillsmuggler/amazon-ratings

2. Home Depot products with descriptions, Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance/data

## Techniques used:

1) Product popularity based recommendation system targeted at new customers.

2) Model-based collaborative filtering system.

3) Item-item based collaborative filtering system.

### Recommendation Technique: 

Once a cluster is identified based on the user's search words, the recommendation system can display items from the corresponding product clusters based on the product descriptions.
